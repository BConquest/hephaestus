Bryant Conquest here.  I am a senior at the University of Alabama graduating December 2020 with a Bachelors of Science with honors.  I am interested in high performance computing, operations systems, and embedded systems--though I enjoy learning all aspects of computer science especially back-end processes.  Outside of programming I enjoy baking and playing disc golf.
